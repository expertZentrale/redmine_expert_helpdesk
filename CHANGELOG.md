## [Unreleased] 2026-07-24 (85)

### Added
- **Administration menu** entry ("expert Helpdesk", with a headset icon) that links directly to
  the plugin settings, so the configuration is reachable in one click from the Administration
  sidebar and the Administration index — instead of going via *Plugins → Configure*. The icon is
  version-aware: a plugin SVG-sprite icon on Redmine 6/7, the legacy `icon-*` CSS icon on Redmine 5
  (`init.rb`, `assets/images/icons.svg`).

### Fixed
- Issue list view: the JavaScript-injected **"Neues Helpdesk-Ticket"** button (next to "Neues Ticket")
  was rendered mangled under Redmine 7 — it still used the old `icon icon-*` CSS class, which Redmine 7
  removed, so no icon was supplied. Like the other JS-generated buttons, it now prepends the SVG sprite
  icon via `window.hdSpriteIcon('email')` (falling back to a plain label when unavailable)
  (`lib/redmine_expert_helpdesk/hooks.rb`).
